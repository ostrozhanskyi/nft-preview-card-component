## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

I'm not really happy with the final version but it's good enough and I spend a lot of time on this challenge. Not really on it but it took me some time to do something.
The most difficult part was an overlay cyan image(or foreground) with transparency and svg on top. And I needed to make it appear only on cursor hover.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Great resource for HTML and CSS references
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Great thing to ask questions about some tricky situations but you shouldn't rely on it too much for learning purposes
